## Overview

Webex Devices let you design your own custom interfaces using its native UI Extensions capabilities. With this example macro, we demonstrate how to programmatically generate a UI Extension panel and process widget and button presses. In this particular example we show how to create a custom keypad to collect number inputs and even included a long press input detection to convert a ``0`` into a ``+``.
